## Simpsons.m
Accurately finds the integral of a inputted matrix using a combination Simpson's 1/3 rule and trapzoid rule if required. This algorithm can be implemented for any sized matrix required.

  INPUTS
  - Vector of independant variables (x)
  - Vector of dependant variables (y)
  
  OUTPUTS
  - Approximate integral
