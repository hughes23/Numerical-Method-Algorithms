## falsePositionpractice.m
With a given function this algroithm will deterime its root within a given interval. The algorithm will terminate depending on whether the given error is reached or number of iterations is met. The default error and iterations are, 0.0001 and 200 respectively. 

  INPUTS

  - Lower guess
  - Upper guess
  - Desired relative error
  - Number of iterations
 
  OUTPUTS
  - Predicted root location
