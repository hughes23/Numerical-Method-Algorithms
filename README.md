# Numerical-Method-Algorithms
This collection of algorithms was created throughout fall semester of 2018 and can be used to accurately estimate or manipulate data. Amoung the possible estimation algorithms are simpson, false position, and golden search methods. The final code, luFactor, allows for easy manipulations of n x n matrices.
