# Numerical-Method-Algorithms
This collection of algorithms was created throughout fall semester of 2018 and can be used to accurately estimate or manipulate data. Among the possible estimation algorithms are simpson, false position, and golden search methods. The final code, luFactor, allows for easy manipulations of n x n matrices. 
## Simpsons.m

## falsePositionpractice.m

## goldenSearch.m

## luFactor.m
Given a 3 x 3 matrix the function will determine the necessary upper, lower, and pivot matrices required. This is useful because once these are found new variables can be inputted to determine their effect on a system.
  INPUTS
  - 3 x 3 matrix
  
  OUTOUTS
  - Lower matrix
  - Upper matrix
  - Pivot matrix
