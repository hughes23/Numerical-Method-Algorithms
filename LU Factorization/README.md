Given a 3 x 3 matrix the algorithm will determine the proper upper, lower, and pivot matrices required. This is useful because once these are found new variables can be inputted to determine their effect on a system.

  INPUTS
  - 3 x 3 matrix
  
  OUTOUTS
  - Lower matrix
  - Upper matrix
  - Pivot matrix
